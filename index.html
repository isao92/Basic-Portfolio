              I have been building small programs and basic webpages learning more and more thanks to my family and all the people around me who have been supporting me. So far basic Java, Python, HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript have been the tools I've been using wether to create a little program or develop a webpage. <br><br>From washing dishes, pedicabing in Coachella to fixing iPhone screens and driving with Uber I've been working all kind of jobs learning and connecting with people. 
              First webpage I did was for my dad and I was 15, pretty much just used the templates and the most code I used was <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i>.
              I want to become more involved in music programming, music webpages services and help local artists with their projects. I am also a singer/songwriter, guitarist and keyboardist and self produce funky rock music. Feel free to contact me and start building something!
